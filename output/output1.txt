1.1.2
 
Customers Need and Want

The famous expressions such as “There’s no place like home” signify that
home or house is a physical place needed for everyone as their private gate-away for
their hectic life. People that have been busy working from day and night or a student
that stayed far from home to further their studies often feel this way when it comes to
home. For many, home is the only warm and cosy place that provides a loving and
supportive environment from the important person in our life. Home has always been
a place for shelter, sanctuary and our homes define ourselves. A house carries a
numbers and different symbolic meanings entrenched in the physical design, the
landscape, and how we decorate our dream house. Every individual in the world have
a desire to purchase a home but each of them may have a different preferences of
their own dream home.
Developer need to have an understanding of their customers’ circumstances,
including a solution to fulfil those needs in order to truly understand customers need
and want. One of the effective ways to identify the customer’s want is by listen
closely to them. By taking time to get to know the customer on their personal level,
developer not only getting information about their customer but at the same time they
able to create customer relationship. With uncounted information and options, home
buyers are struggling to find the property that best meets their need. The most
challenging task of the developer is to seek out their customer’s desire even when the
customer cannot figure it out themselves.
In the property sector, developer or real estate investor can gain customer
insight through internal and external feedback. One of the ways is by posting an
online feedback through social media channel. Social media tools are not only can be
used to have a better understanding of customer needs, but these tools also can
convert the information into key patterns. Developer should keep an eye on these
three (3) factors such as customer sentiment, key issues and tone of voice to ensure<p>=============( 18 )=============</p>

1.1.3
 
Current Trend and Attributes

Even though Malaysian economic growth and property market is currently
downshifted, Malaysia property market is still an interesting option as Malaysia has a
well-developed infrastructure that connects among the region in the country that
offers cheaper property option among Asian country and ranked as third country
after China and India among the off-shoring destinations (Saiful, 2016). Based on
Malaysia’s major states property searches behaviour in 2011 to 2015, the citizen in
Johor and Selangor both preferred property priced below RM300, 000 and above
RM900, 000 but they have different preferences in type of the property. The home
buyer’s in Johor prefer a terrace or linked homes meanwhile the home buyer’s in
Selangor mostly prefer for a high rises (Mangelesri, 2016).
The Millennial home buyers now have a different expectation compared to
the Baby Boomers home buyers as the Millennial demand for facilities that allow
them a live a certain lifestyle. In this trend, developers may need to look at the
physical layout, architecture and design of the residential units.

1.1.4
 
Economic on Property

In 2017, economic growth of Malaysia is predicted to downshifts due to the
challenging global economic and financial landscape. The key driver of growth is
forecasted to be domestic demands that are sustained primarily by economic activity
from the private sector. According to Bank Negara Malaysia 2016’s statistic, the
growth of outstanding household loans of the banking system and DFIs moderated to
5.5% in fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 5.8% in third quarter in 2016. The
moderation in outstanding loans is generally for the purchase of residential property
and passengers cars. This proved that the biggest investment for Malaysian is houses.
As for that, the supply and demand for residential property will continues to rise in<p>=============( 19 )=============</p>

As for the property market in Johor, it will continue to be slow until the end
of 2017 due to the general economic conditions as well as property cooling measures
in the country. The biggest challenges of all are the increasing compliance cost along
with low end-financing approval rate for home buyers (REDHA, 2016).
The Sultan of Johor has an intention to make Johor Bahru as the second
largest city in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur as Johor Bahru has a strategic advantage
which is located next to island country in Southeast Asia which referred as “Lion
City” or Singapore. There were many countries that have two competing cities such
as Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, Los Angeles and New York in United States,
and Beijing and Shanghai in China. The wave of investment from China helps to heal
locals and economic growth for the state and will ultimately contribute to Malaysia’s
growth (Wan Saiful, 2017). There are many developing area in Johor Bahru that
currently being constructed such as Iskandar Malaysia and Forest City. Forest City is
expected to be completed in twenty (20) years with four (4) man-made islands. By
2035, one hundred thousand (100, 000) of people are predicted to live there and the
developer expects two hundred twenty thousand (220, 000) jobs to be offered.
According to CBRE Malaysia 2017, Johor as a runner up for the most active
city in property market, Iskandar Malaysia’s radical development plan is already in
its second half of its 20-year framework which is 2006 to 2025. Sixty percent (60%)
of the region’s cumulative investment of RM 208 billion is said funded by local
investors. Fifty one percent (51%) of the total investment which is the largest
contributor to the committed investments is realised on the ground coming from<p>=============( 20 )=============</p>

Problem Statement

The aim of the study is to identify the factors influencing home buyer’s
purchase decision in Johor Bahru. In today’s era, there is a radical change in the
people’s life style. People prefer to live a comfortable life to fulfil their life-time
ambition. The term of ‘living a comfortable life’ is very subjective as some of the
people might prefer to have a comfortable living by owning luxury cars and rich
looks, travelling, but there are also some of the people that prefer to invest in
purchasing a residential property rather than buying a luxury car (Jessica, 2016). It’s
depends on each individual’s priorities. For the people that choose a residential
property as their main priorities, they tend to have a very specific idea or preferences
for their dream house.
According to Cansu (2015), the people’s life styles are changing as the world
keep on revolving. The development of new products and service is needed in order
to satisfy the society’s increasing demand. Housing sector is one of the sectors that
effected in this development as people’s housing preferences is changing because of
the urban life evolvement. The housing sector needs to re-form as the background of
the home buyers keep on changing. Nowadays, there are a little too many developers
competing with one another in term of sales, marketing, branding and market share
(Tan, 2012). They are willing to do anything to win purchaser’s heart. As the
competition getting tougher, developer needs to be alert with the customer’s needs or
expectations to satisfy the home buyer’s preferences. The main problem is that the
feedback from one client cannot be used to another client as their preferences may
vary from one another.
In Johor Bahru, there are wide range of products such as residential, offices
and commercial property offered by developers. As there are too many developers in
the market, consumers have plenty of choices to choose and it may be difficult for
developer to sell their products in the tremendous competition. Part of it is the
location, amenities, reputation of the developers and price (Tan, 2012). Beyond that,
most buyers having a predicament as to what factors are the most important in<p>=============( 21 )=============</p>

Research Questions

The following are the research questions which are important in this study:
1.
 
What are the factors that influence the home buyer’s purchase intention?
2.
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
influence
 
factor
 
that

Research Objectives

The general objective of the study is to obtain the factors that home buyers
delve into upon purchasing a residential property in Johor Bahru that stated in the
problem statement. Specific objective is obtained by narrowing down the general
objective.
The main objective of this study is to investigate and identify the factors that
influencing home buyer’s purchase intention in Johor Bahru. Furthermore, this study
will be useful for developers to find out which housing attributes that most favoured<p>=============( 22 )=============</p>

These are the three (3) objectives on why the researcher conducts this survey are
listed as below:
1.

the
 
relationship
 
between
 
the

buyer’s
purchase intention.

1.5
 
Scope and Key assumption of the study

The scope of this research will be focusing on identifying the housing
attributes influencing home buyer’s purchase decision in Johor Bahru. It is almost
impossible for developers to satisfy the needs and wants of the entire customer at the
time as their preferences is differ from one individual to another and there is not set
benchmark to adopt them in real life. The questionnaires are distributed among
visitors at property events in Johor Bahru.
Key assumption of this research is that the respondents will respond with an
honest feedback when they answering the questionnaire. It is assumed that not all of
the visitors are willing to answer the questionnaire but with a brief and clear
explanation, the respondent will be able to understand the purpose of this research<p>=============( 23 )=============</p>

1.6
 
Importance of the study

The significant of this study is to identify the primary factors that push Johor
Bahru home buyers to purchase a residential property in Johor Bahru, Johor. This
research will benefit the property developers as they gain more knowledge on the
best preferences of the housing attributes among the home buyers. By having
knowledge on home buyer’s preferences, the developer will aware of the home
buyer’s wants and preferences before launching new projects. Only prestigious
developers will succeed in spreading positive word of mouth among the purchasers
and their social circle (Chin, 2016), so this research will not only help the developers
to contemplate the factors that able to affect home buyer’s purchase intention in
Johor Bahru, but also finding the most preferred housing attributes when purchasing
their dream house. By matching the demand with the market, developer also will be
able to increase their sales.
As the marketer played an important role is observing customer behaviour,
their purchase pattern and intention, this research also will be beneficial for the
marketer as they can learn and gain more knowledge about the home buyer’s most
preferred housing attribute and the crucial factors that home buyers will consider
upon purchasing a residential property in Johor Bahru. Furthermore, this study will
be investigating the relationship on how the demographic criteria such as age,
income level, occupation, marital status affect home buyer’s purchase intention in
Johor Bahru.
Last but not least, this research will be useful as references or guidelines for
future researcher that wishes to learn and gain more understanding and knowledge
regarding the residential property and the current property market. Overall, this
research
 
will
 
be
 
beneficial
 
to
 
the

developers,
 
marketers
 
and

Standard of Residential Property

The standard setting a residential property is categorized as an on-going
process that needed a continuous improvement and developer have to listen to the
market demand in order to succeed in meeting the standard. International Property
